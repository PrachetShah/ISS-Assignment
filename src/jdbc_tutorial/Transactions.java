/*
 * If your JDBC Connection is in auto-commit mode, which it is by default, then every 
 * SQL statement is committed to the database upon its completion.
 * That may be fine for simple applications, but there are three reasons why you may 
 * want to turn off the auto-commit and manage your own transactions âˆ’ 
 * 1.To increase performance.
 * 2.To maintain the integrity of business processes.
 * 3.To use distributed transactions.
 * 
 * Transactions enable you to control if, and when, changes are applied to the database. 
 * It treats a single SQL statement or a group of SQL statements as one logical unit, 
 * and if any statement fails, the whole transaction fails.
 * 
 * We can also rollback to specified **SAVEPOINT** if given in rollback(savepoint)
 * --set a Savepoint 
 * Savepoint savepoint1 = conn.setSavepoint("Savepoint1");
 * 
 * -- delete savepoint
 * releaseSavepoint(String name);
